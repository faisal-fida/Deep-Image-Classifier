# Deep Learning Image Classification

This repository contains a Python code implementation for a deep learning model used for image classification. The model is trained on a custom dataset using a 10-layer deep architecture. The code performs data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction on random images.

## Dataset

The dataset should be organized in the following structure:
